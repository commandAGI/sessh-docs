# Sessh

Sessh is a persistent SSH session manager that enables one-shot CLI commands to operate long-lived interactive shells on remote hosts. Perfect for AI agents like Cursor that can only run single commands.

## The Problem

AI coding assistants like Cursor can only run **single commands** that terminate immediately. But many workflows require **persistent interactive shells** that maintain state (current directory, environment variables, active processes) between commands.

Traditional SSH tools either:
- Require interactive sessions (not usable by AI agents)
- Run commands in isolation (no state persistence)
- Use complex connection management (hard to automate)

## The Solution

Sessh combines **SSH ControlMaster** (persistent connections) with **remote tmux** (persistent interactive shells) to give you:

- **Single-command interface**: Every command terminates immediately
- **Persistent state**: The remote shell maintains state between commands
- **AI agent friendly**: Perfect for Cursor and other MCP clients
- **Autonomous workflows**: Launch infrastructure → SSH → train models → terminate, all automatically

## How It Works

Sessh combines two proven technologies:

1. **SSH ControlMaster/ControlPersist**: Persistent TCP connections (reused across commands)
2. **Remote tmux**: Persistent interactive shells (maintains state between commands)

```
AI Agent (Cursor)
    ↓ single commands
sessh CLI
    ↓ SSH ControlMaster (persistent)
Remote Host
    ↓ tmux session (persistent shell)
Your Commands
```

When you run `sessh open agent ubuntu@host`:
- Opens a persistent **master connection** to the remote host
- This connection stays alive for 8 hours (configurable)
- Creates a **detached tmux session** on the remote host
- All subsequent commands **reuse** this connection (instant, no handshake)

When you run `sessh run agent ubuntu@host -- "command"`:
1. **Reuses master connection** (instant, no SSH handshake)
2. **Sends command via tmux**: `tmux send-keys -t agent "command" C-m`
3. **Returns immediately** (command runs in background tmux session)
4. **State persists**: Next command sees same cwd, same environment

## Features

- **Persistent Sessions**: SSH ControlMaster/ControlPersist multiplexing with tmux on remote hosts
- **Autossh Support**: Automatic reconnection with keepalives
- **Ramfs Control Sockets**: Fast socket communication when available
- **Hardened SSH Options**: Modern KEX, ciphers, and MACs
- **JSON Output Mode**: Machine-friendly responses for automation
- **ProxyJump Support**: Jump through bastion hosts
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
