# Sessh Ecosystem

A collection of tools for enabling AI agents to manage persistent SSH sessions on remote hosts. Perfect for autonomous workflows like launching GPU instances, training models, and terminating infrastructure—all without human intervention.

## Philosophy

Sessh exists to solve one specific problem: **AI agents like Cursor can only run single commands that terminate immediately, but they need to operate persistent interactive shells on remote hosts**.

### Core Principles

1. **Fail Loudly, Not Gracefully**: No fallbacks or backwards compatibility. If something breaks, it breaks clearly.
2. **Single-Command Interface**: Every operation terminates immediately. The persistent shell lives on in tmux on the remote.
3. **Real Implementations**: We use real POSIX tools (SSH ControlMaster, tmux) rather than abstractions.
4. **Autonomous by Default**: Enable fully automated workflows. Launch → SSH → Train → Terminate.
5. **Security First**: Hardened SSH defaults, key-only auth, modern cipher suites.

## Projects

### [sessh](/cli) - Core CLI

The bash script that does the heavy lifting. Combines SSH ControlMaster/ControlPersist with remote tmux to create persistent interactive shells.

**Key Features**:
- Persistent SSH connections (ControlMaster)
- Remote tmux sessions (stateful shells)
- JSON output mode for automation
- Autossh support for auto-reconnection
- Hardened SSH defaults

### [sessh-mcp](/sdk/mcp) - MCP Server for Cursor

Model Context Protocol server that exposes sessh functionality to Cursor and other MCP clients.

**Key Features**:
- MCP stdio transport
- All sessh commands as MCP tools
- TypeScript with full type safety
- Zero dependencies (uses Node.js built-ins)

### [sessh-python-sdk](/sdk/python) - Python SDK

Pure stdlib Python client for managing persistent SSH sessions. No external dependencies.

**Key Features**:
- Pure Python stdlib (no dependencies)
- Type hints for better IDE support
- Simple API: `client.open()`, `client.run()`, `client.logs()`

### [sessh-typescript-sdk](/sdk/typescript) - TypeScript SDK

Promise-based TypeScript client for managing persistent SSH sessions from Node.js or browsers.

**Key Features**:
- Zero dependencies (Node.js built-ins only)
- Promise-based async API
- Full TypeScript type definitions

## Quick Start

### For AI Agents (Cursor)

1. **Install sessh CLI**: See [Installation](/cli#installation)
2. **Install and configure sessh-mcp**: See [MCP Server Setup](/sdk/mcp#cursor-configuration)
3. **Use in Cursor**: Open session, run commands, check logs

### For Python Scripts

```bash
pip install -e sessh-python-sdk/
```

```python
from sessh import SesshClient

client = SesshClient(alias="agent", host="ubuntu@host")
client.open()
client.run("your-command")
```

### For TypeScript/Node.js

```bash
cd sessh-typescript-sdk && npm install && npm run build
```

```typescript
import { SesshClient } from "sessh-sdk";

const client = new SesshClient({ alias: "agent", host: "ubuntu@host" });
await client.open();
await client.run("your-command");
```

## Architecture

Sessh combines two technologies:

1. **SSH ControlMaster/ControlPersist**: Persistent TCP connections (reused across commands)
2. **Remote tmux**: Persistent interactive shells (maintains state between commands)

```
AI Agent (Cursor)
    ↓ single commands
sessh CLI
    ↓ SSH ControlMaster (persistent)
Remote Host
    ↓ tmux session (persistent shell)
Your Commands
```
